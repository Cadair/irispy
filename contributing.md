# Contributing to SlitSpectrographPy
------------------------------------

SlitSpectrographPy is an open project that enourages everyone to contribute in any way possible.
This document descibes how to contribute code and documentation to the SlitSpectrographPy repository.

## Basic Contribution Workflow

* Get a [GitHub Account](https://github.com/signup/free)
* [Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo) the IRISpy repo
to your own github account.
* [Clone](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/) your
forked version of IRISpy from your github account to your local machine.
* Make your changes locally and push them to your fork.
* Create a [Pull Request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests).

## Pull Request Review

When you submit a pull request it can be reviewed and commented on by anyone.
For the code to be accepted into IRISpy it must meet the following criteria:

* Conform to code quality standards, primarily [PEP8](http://legacy.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/).
* Have close to 100% unit test coverage.
* Have API documentation generated by astropy's automodapi extenstion where appropriate.
* Contain an entry in the CHANGELOG.md file.
* Be approved by at least two IRISpy contributors.


## Pull Requests to non-master Branches

From time to time, large feature development work may occur in branches other than master, and all 
maintained releases currently have a branch i.e. `0.6`.
When making a PR to one of these branches, please put the name of the branch in square brackets at 
the beginning of the PR, i.e. `[0.6] My bug fix`. This makes it easier to filter and review these PRs.
